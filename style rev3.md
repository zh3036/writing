# PTO and  leaves
## illness
If illness or injury requires that you miss more than three days of work, Sick Days will be used first (provided you are eligible for Sick Days), Paid Time Off (PTO) will be used next, then unpaid Leave.

## disability cover
if you are eligible for Short- or Long-Term Disability coverage, you may apply for that coverage but all accrued PTO must be exhausted before that coverage will apply. 

## approed leave
Absences of less than three days from scheduled work will automatically utilize your accrued PTO unless prior approval was obtained for another category of Leave of Absence.
Approved paid Leaves (e.g. Bereavement Leave and Leave for Jury Duty) do not require that PTO be used first, but PTO may be used to supplement these approved Leaves of Absence, subject to a Director’s approval.

## concurrency
All accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (and, in the case of Leave for medical reasons, accrued Sick Days) must be exhausted before any other form of Leave can take effect (except Leave for Jury Duty and Bereavement Leave). PTO and/or Sick Days do not add to the specific Leave duration. Accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (plus accrued Sick Days in the case of Leave for medical reasons) are concurrent with any other type of Leave and accrued, awarded, or begins and do not add to the length of the Leave. Only accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (and accrued Sick Days if applicable) can be used.

## accrue
Employees do not accrue PTO or Sick Days while on any Leave (except the portion of the absence that utilizes accrued PTO and/or accrued Sick Days).## advanceThe Senior Director of Human Resources may approve an advancement of un-accrued PTO with a Director’s recommendation but the total amount of PTO advanced (accrued to date plus advance) cannot exceed the total amount that an employee might accrue for that calendar year.

### leave and pay
In the event that an employee does not return from an absence that included advance PTO and/or advance Sick Days,the pay of leave applied,

 the advance un-accrued PTO plus any advance un-accrued Sick Days taken will be deducted from any pay or bonus that may be owed to the employee by DAM. In the case that the value of the advance un-accrued PTO and/or Sick Days exceeds any amount owed to them by DAM, the employee will be billed for that amount and every legal action will be taken to secure the repayment of the advance un-accrued PTO and/or Sick Days.
