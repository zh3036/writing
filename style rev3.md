### effect of treat
1. no punish meant but no exceptions for this

2. DAM encourages anyone with a substance abuse problem to seek treatment before the condition affects your health or your job performance. Employees who, voluntarily and in good faith, seek qualified treatment will not be penalized for recognizing the issue and seeking treatment. However, they will be held to the same standards of conduct as other employees.Thus, and employee should take advantage of substance abuse treatment before a performance problem results in discipline or discharge. Treatment programs do not immunize employees from discipline for unacceptable conduct. Rather, they are made available to help employees deal with such problems in a positive and constructive manner.
